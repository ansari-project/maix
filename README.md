## Development Methodology: DAPPER

MAIX follows the **DAPPER** methodology for structured development:

### DAPPER Overview
```
D - Design    : AI explores and proposes multiple approaches
A - Align     : Human decides and aligns on direction
P - Plan      : Break into executable phases with ITRC structure
P - Produce   : Build, test, review, commit & push
E - Evaluate  : Comprehensive review of all work
R - Revise    : Update docs and capture lessons learned
```

### When to Use DAPPER
**Use for:** New features, complex refactoring, architecture changes, significant complexity  
**Skip for:** Simple bug fixes, text changes, configuration updates, straightforward dependencies

### ITRC Development Cycle
Each development phase follows the **ITRC** structure:
- **I (Implement)**: Build the functionality
- **T (Test)**: Write and run tests immediately
- **R (Review)**: Code review for quality
- **C (Commit & Push)**: Version control with clear messages

For detailed DAPPER documentation, see `CLAUDE.md` (for AI agents) or `dev_docs/ref/dapper-methodology.md` (for humans).

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Philosophy
**FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**: A small number of well-thought-out tests is better than a large number of poor tests. Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details.

### Testing Priorities
1. **Integration Tests (60%)** - Real database, real constraints
2. **Unit Tests (30%)** - Only for pure business logic  
3. **E2E Tests (10%)** - Critical user paths

### Test Database Setup (Docker)
```bash
# Start test database (port 5433)
npm run test:db:start

# Run tests
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests with real DB
npm run test:unit        # Unit tests only
npm run test:all         # Both suites

# Stop test database
npm run test:db:stop
```

**Test Database Configuration:**
- Runs on port 5433 (production uses 5432)
- Database: `maix_test`, User: `testuser`, Password: `testpass`
- Real database operations, not mocks
- Database cleaned between tests

### Available Test Commands
- `npm test` - All tests (unit + integration if DB running)
- `npm run test:unit` - Unit tests only
- `npm run test:integration` - Integration tests with real database
- `npm run test:watch` - Watch mode for development
- `npm run test:db:start` - Start Docker test database
- `npm run test:db:stop` - Stop Docker test database

## Development Guidelines

### Development Principles

#### Simplicity and Pragmatism
- **Bias towards simple solutions**: Address current problems, not hypothetical future ones
- **Avoid premature optimization**: Don't implement complex patterns for problems that don't exist
- **Use straightforward Prisma queries**: Direct queries rather than complex abstraction layers
- **Focus on current scale**: Design for today's usage patterns
- **Iterative complexity**: Add complexity only when simple solutions prove insufficient

#### Security Model
**Context**: Community platform for volunteer matching
- **What we are**: A community platform, non-profit focused
- **What we're NOT**: Financial service, healthcare system, or PII-heavy
- **Security Approach**: 
  - Focus on basics (input validation with Zod)
  - Skip security theater (no complex CSRF, rate limiting)
  - Pragmatic protection (Prisma prevents SQL injection, React prevents XSS)
  - Basic session management with NextAuth

### Database Management

#### Safe Migration Workflow (AI-Compatible)
```bash
# Step 1: Create migration (non-interactive)
npm run db:migrate:new descriptive_name

# Step 2: Review generated SQL
cat prisma/migrations/*/migration.sql

# Step 3: Apply when ready
npm run db:migrate:apply
```

**NEVER use:**
- `npx prisma db push` - Destructive, drops/recreates tables
- `npx prisma migrate dev` - Interactive, breaks AI agents

**Safe Commands:**
- `db:migrate:new` - Create migration via migrate diff
- `db:migrate:apply` - Apply migrations via deploy
- `db:migrate:status` - Check migration status
- `db:backup` - Backup database
- `db:health` - Health check
- `db:studio` - Prisma Studio (read-only recommended)

### Code Quality

**Quick health check:**
```bash
npm audit --audit-level=moderate  # Fix Critical/High only
grep -r "console\." src/ | wc -l  # Should trend down
npm outdated                       # Update only if needed
npm run lint                       # ESLint checks
npm run type-check                # TypeScript validation
npm run build                     # Build validation
```

### Git Best Practices
- Use descriptive commit messages explaining purpose
- Use `git add [specific-files]` - never `git add .` or `git add -A`
- Always check remote before pushing: `git fetch origin && git status`
- Never force push to shared branches
- If push fails, stop and investigate

## Claude Code Integration

MAIX provides a remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows you to manage your profile and projects directly through Claude Code CLI.

### Quick Setup
1. **Generate a Personal Access Token** at https://maix.io/settings (API Tokens section)
2. **Add the MCP server** to Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http --scope user maix-platform https://maix.io/api/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PAT_TOKEN_HERE"
   ```
3. **Start using Claude Code** to manage your MAIX profile and projects

### Available Commands
- "Update my MAIX profile to add React and TypeScript skills"
- "Create a new AI project for building a chatbot"
- "List all my projects"
- "Update project [id] to need 5 volunteers"

For detailed setup instructions, see [docs/howtos/claude-code-setup.md](docs/howtos/claude-code-setup.md).

## Debugging Guide

### Quick CI/CD Debugging with GitHub CLI
```bash
gh run list --limit 5              # Check recent runs
gh run view <RUN_ID>               # View run details
gh run view --log-failed --job=<ID> # Get error logs
```

**Pro Tips:**
- Don't use `sleep` commands - work asynchronously
- Use `--log-failed` for relevant error information
- Check status periodically while working on other tasks

For comprehensive debugging strategies, see `dev_docs/ref/debugging-playbook.md`.

# Following System Implementation Plan - Initial

## Overview
Implement following system for organizations, projects, and products with polymorphic database design, unified role system, and phased notification rollout.

**Key Expert Refinements Applied:**
- Phase dependency optimization for parallel development
- Asynchronous notification architecture for scalability
- Enhanced database migration safety protocols
- Comprehensive performance testing requirements

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Database Migration & Core Schema
**Objective**: Establish database foundation with safe role system migration

#### Phase 1-I: Implement - Database Schema Changes
- Add `Following` table with polymorphic relationships and optimized indexes:
  ```sql
  @@index([followableId, followableType])  -- Critical for getFollowers()
  @@index([userId, followableType])        -- Critical for getUserFollowing()
  @@unique([userId, followableId, followableType])
  ```
- Add `FollowableType` enum (ORGANIZATION, PROJECT, PRODUCT)  
- Add nullable `unifiedRole` field to `OrganizationMember` (expand phase)
- Generate and review Prisma migration files

**Success Criteria**: 
- Migration generated without errors with specified composite indexes
- Both old `role` and new `unifiedRole` fields exist in `OrganizationMember`

## Dependencies

### Phase Dependencies (Optimized for Parallel Development)
- **Phase 2** depends on **Phase 1** (schema must exist before role migration)
- **Phase 3** depends on **Phase 1** (Following table must exist)
- **Phase 4** depends on **Phase 3** (service layer needed for APIs)
- **Phase 5** depends on **Phase 3** (service layer needed for notifications) âš¡ **OPTIMIZED - Not Phase 4**
- **Phase 6** depends on **Phase 4** (APIs needed for UI)
- **Phase 7** depends on **Phase 2** (dual write must be established)

**Note**: Phase 4 and Phase 5 can be developed in parallel after Phase 3 completion

### External Dependencies
- Prisma ORM for database operations
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Existing notification system for activity feeds
- Existing entity permission systems

## Risk Mitigation

### Database Migration Risks
- **Risk**: Migration fails or causes downtime
- **Mitigation**: Use expand-and-contract pattern, test migrations thoroughly

### Performance Risks  
- **Risk**: Following queries are slow at scale
- **Mitigation**: Proper indexing, performance testing, monitoring

### Data Integrity Risks
- **Risk**: Orphaned following records
- **Mitigation**: Cascade deletes, validation in service layer

### API Consistency Risks
- **Risk**: APIs don't match existing patterns
- **Mitigation**: Review existing API patterns, use consistent service layer

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- All database migrations complete without errors
- API response times under 200ms for following operations
- Zero data integrity issues
- 100% test coverage on service layer

### User Experience Metrics
- Follow/unfollow operations complete in under 1 second
- Activity feed loads in under 2 seconds
- No user-reported bugs in following functionality

## Rollback Plan

### Phase-Level Rollback
- Each phase commits working functionality
- Can rollback to previous phase if issues arise
- Database migrations can be reversed if needed

### Emergency Rollback
- Feature flag to disable following UI if needed
- Database rollback scripts for each migration
- Service layer can be disabled without affecting core platform

## Next Steps

This plan will be reviewed by the user and refined based on feedback. Once approved, implementation will begin with Phase 1.

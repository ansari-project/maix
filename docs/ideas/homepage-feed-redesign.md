# Homepage Feed Redesign

## Current State

The current homepage design presents users with 6 main action cards in a grid layout:
- My Profile
- Browse Projects  
- Post a Project
- My Applications
- Messages
- Community

## Proposed Change

### New Layout Structure

**Sidebar Navigation:**
- Move all 6 current action items to a persistent sidebar
- Sidebar should be collapsible on mobile devices
- Use Islamic-themed iconography for each navigation item

**Main Content Area:**
- Replace the grid of cards with a dynamic feed of updates
- Feed should be the primary focus of the homepage experience

### Feed Content Types

**Project Updates:**

**Community Activity:**

### Design Considerations

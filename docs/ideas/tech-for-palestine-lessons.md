# Lessons from Tech for Palestine for MAIX Platform

*Research Date: July 2025*

## Overview

Tech for Palestine (T4P) is a coalition of thousands of tech professionals working to support Palestinian liberation through technology. Starting as a Discord community, it has evolved into a 501(c)(3) nonprofit incubator that supports advocacy projects from idea to launch. Their success offers valuable lessons for MAIX's mission of connecting volunteers with meaningful AI/tech projects.

# Structured Content Design: From Posts to Purposeful Content

**Date**: 2025-07-18  
**Status**: Analysis Complete - Ready for Implementation Planning  

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a strategic shift from generic "posts" to structured content types that drive purposeful engagement and community value. Instead of users posting in a vacuum, all content will serve specific purposes: asking questions, sharing answers, providing project updates, or announcing product progress.

## Current State Analysis

**What we have now**:
- No existing post/feed system (clean slate opportunity)
- Strong project/volunteer matching foundation
- User profiles with skills and experience
- Direct messaging system
- Product and project management

**What we're missing**:
- Community knowledge sharing
- Public discourse and problem-solving
- Project transparency and accountability
- Learning and skill development platform

## Proposed Solution: Structured Content Types

### Content Types

1. **Questions** (`QUESTION`)
   - Community members ask technical, career, or project-related questions
   - Must have: title, body, optional tags
   - Can be marked as solved, have accepted answers

2. **Answers** (`ANSWER`) 
   - Responses to questions
   - Must have: body, reference to parent question
   - Can be marked as "best answer" by question author

3. **Project Updates** (`PROJECT_UPDATE`)
   - Progress reports from ongoing projects
   - Must have: body, linked project ID
   - Keeps volunteers and community informed of progress

4. **Product Updates** (`PRODUCT_UPDATE`)
   - Announcements about product milestones, launches, features
   - Must have: body, linked product ID
   - Builds excitement and showcases community successes

## Strategic Benefits

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Database Design

**Recommended Approach**: Polymorphic Single-Table Inheritance

```prisma
model Post {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  authorId  String
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])

  type PostType // Discriminator field

  // Common fields
  title     String?  // Required for QUESTION, optional for others
  body      String   // Content body

  // Type-specific data stored as JSON for flexibility
  metadata  Json?    // Store type-specific fields like tags, difficulty, etc.

  // Hierarchical relationships
  parentId  String?  // For answers replying to questions
  parent    Post?    @relation("PostReplies", fields: [parentId], references: [id])
  replies   Post[]   @relation("PostReplies")

  // External relationships
  projectId String?  // For project updates
  project   Project? @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id])
  
  productId String?  // For product updates  
  product   Product? @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])

  // Engagement fields
  isResolved Boolean @default(false) // For questions
  bestAnswerId String? // Reference to best answer

  @@index([type, createdAt])
  @@index([authorId])
  @@index([projectId])
  @@index([productId])
  @@map("posts")
}

enum PostType {
  QUESTION
  ANSWER
  PROJECT_UPDATE
  PRODUCT_UPDATE
}
```

**Why This Approach**:
- ✅ Unified feed queries are simple
- ✅ Easy to add new content types
- ✅ Flexible metadata storage
- ✅ Maintains referential integrity
- ⚠️ Some type safety trade-offs (managed in application layer)

### API Design

**Content Creation Endpoints**:
```
POST /api/content/questions    # Create question
POST /api/content/answers      # Answer a question  
POST /api/content/updates/project # Project update
POST /api/content/updates/product # Product update
```

**Feed Endpoints**:
```
GET /api/feed                  # Unified feed (all types)
GET /api/feed?type=QUESTION    # Filtered by type
GET /api/questions             # Q&A specific feed
GET /api/projects/{id}/updates # Project-specific updates
```

### UI/UX Design

**Component-Driven Rendering**:
```tsx
const ContentCard = ({ post }: { post: Post }) => {
  switch (post.type) {
    case 'QUESTION':
      return <QuestionCard post={post} />
    case 'ANSWER':
      return <AnswerCard post={post} />
    case 'PROJECT_UPDATE':
      return <ProjectUpdateCard post={post} />
    case 'PRODUCT_UPDATE':
      return <ProductUpdateCard post={post} />
    default:
      return null
  }
}
```

**Creation Flow**:
1. User clicks "Create Content" 
2. Modal/dropdown shows content type options
3. Type-specific form with appropriate fields
4. Validation ensures required fields for each type

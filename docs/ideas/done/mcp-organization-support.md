# MCP Organization Support (COMPLETED)

## Overview
Added organization support to MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, enabling AI assistants to manage organization-owned resources.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dual Ownership Model
- Resources (projects/products) can be owned by either a user OR an organization
- Enforced mutual exclusivity - exactly one owner required
- Organization members can manage organization-owned resources based on their role

### 2. MCP Tool Updates
- **manageProduct**: Added organizationId support for creating/managing organization products
- **manageProject**: Added organizationId support for creating/managing organization projects  
- **manageOrganization**: New tool for organization CRUD operations
- **manageOrganizationMember**: New tool for managing organization membership

### 3. Security & Validation
- Organization membership validation before allowing resource creation
- Role-based access control (OWNER role required for destructive operations)
- Proper error handling with ValidationError for 400 responses
- Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- All existing user-owned resources continue to work
- Default behavior remains user ownership when no organizationId provided
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts

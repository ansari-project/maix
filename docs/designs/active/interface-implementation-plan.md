# Complete Interface Redesign - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
Implementation of the complete interface redesign following the DAPPER process. This plan breaks down the work into 6 phases, each delivering working functionality that can be tested and validated.

**Core Layout Principle:**
```
Every Page = Sidebar (200px) + Main Content + AI Assistant (bottom)
- Home Page Only: Main Content = Actions (50%) + Community (50%)  
- All Other Pages: Main Content = Single Panel (100%)
```

---

## Phase 1: Core Layout System Foundation
**Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Goal:** Create the foundational layout system that all pages will use

### Components to Build
1. **`components/layout/DashboardLayout.tsx`**
   - Grid/flexbox structure for sidebar + main + AI
   - Responsive breakpoints
   - Layout state management with Context
   
2. **`components/navigation/Sidebar.tsx`**
   - Navigation items with active state
   - Apps section (Causemon, Event Manager)
   - Collapsible behavior for mobile
   - User avatar and profile link

3. **`components/layout/MainContent.tsx`**
   - Flexible container that accepts children
   - Handles both single and dual panel layouts
   - Proper spacing and overflow handling

4. **`contexts/LayoutContext.tsx`**
   - Sidebar collapsed/expanded state
   - AI assistant visibility state
   - Current page tracking for active states

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Layout renders without errors on all existing pages
- [ ] Sidebar shows current page with active state highlighting
- [ ] Navigation between pages works correctly
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Responsive behavior works (sidebar collapses on mobile)

### Testing Strategy
```typescript
// Test actual navigation behavior
describe('DashboardLayout', () => {
  it('should navigate between pages and update active state', async () => {
    const { getByText, getByRole } = render(<DashboardLayout />)
    const projectsLink = getByText('Projects')
    fireEvent.click(projectsLink)
    expect(projectsLink).toHaveAttribute('aria-current', 'page')
  })
  
  it('should collapse sidebar on mobile viewports', async () => {
    // Test responsive behavior, not CSS classes
  })
})
```

    const trigger = getByRole('button', { name: /ask ai/i })
    fireEvent.click(trigger)
    
    const input = getByPlaceholderText(/type your message/i)
    fireEvent.change(input, { target: { value: 'Find React projects' } })
    fireEvent.submit(input.form)
    
    // Test that API was called with correct context
    expect(mockClaudeAPI).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      expect.objectContaining({ 
        message: 'Find React projects',
        context: expect.objectContaining({ page: 'home' })
      })
    )

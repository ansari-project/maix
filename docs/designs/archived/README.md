# Archived Designs

Designs are moved to this directory when:

1. **Feature Abandoned**: The feature is no longer needed or has been replaced by a different approach
2. **Superseded**: A new design document replaces this one
3. **Deprecated**: The feature has been removed from the product

## Archival Process

When archiving a design:
1. Move the file here using `git mv`
2. Add a note at the top of the document explaining:
   - Date of archival
   - Reason for archival
   - Link to replacement design (if applicable)

## Retention Policy

- Keep archived designs for historical reference
- They provide valuable context for why certain decisions were made
- Only delete if they contain sensitive information that should not be retained

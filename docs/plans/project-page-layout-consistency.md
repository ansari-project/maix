# Project Page Layout Consistency Plan

## Problem Statement

The project detail pages have inconsistent layout compared to the rest of the application:
1. Different visual styling (dark gradient vs light backgrounds)
2. Unique "Back to Projects" navigation not found elsewhere
3. Missing prominent call-to-action for volunteering
4. Overall layout structure differs from other pages

## Design (D)

### Goals
- Achieve visual consistency with other pages (dashboard, search, products)
- Remove unique navigation patterns
- Add prominent volunteer call-to-action
- Follow established design patterns

### Proposed Changes

#### 1. Background and Container Styling
- Change from dark gradient (`bg-gradient-to-br from-primary to-accent`) to light gradient (`bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/5 to-accent/5`)
- Update container padding to match standard pages (`px-4 py-2`)
- Use consistent spacing patterns

#### 2. Navigation Changes
- Remove standalone "Back to Projects" button
- Rely on main navigation and breadcrumbs for navigation consistency

#### 3. Call-to-Action Placement
- Move "Apply to Volunteer" button to top header section
- Make it prominent with larger size (`size="lg"`)
- Show application status if already applied
- Position "View Applications" (for owners) in header as well

#### 4. Layout Structure
Reorganize to follow standard pattern:
```
Header Section
- Project title and description
- Primary CTA button
- Status badges

Main Content Area (2-column layout)
- Left: Main content (about, requirements, updates)
- Right: Sidebar (project details, contact info)
```

#### 5. Additional Features
- Add Project Updates section for communication
- Allow project owners and volunteers to post updates
- Display updates with timestamps and engagement metrics

## Review (R) - To be done with mcp__zen__thinkdeep

Key questions for review:
- Does this maintain accessibility standards?
- Are we removing any critical functionality?
- Does this improve or maintain the user journey?
- Are there any edge cases we haven't considered?

## Simplify (S)

Keep it simple by:
- Using existing UI components (no new components needed)
- Following established patterns from other pages
- Not adding complex new features beyond basic updates
- Leveraging existing POST API for updates

### Based on Review Feedback

The expert review identified some potential enhancements, but in the spirit of simplicity:

1. **Rejected Applications**: Current implementation is sufficient for MVP. Users can see their application status. If needed later, we can add re-application logic.

2. **Updates Pagination**: Not needed now. Most projects won't have many updates initially. We can add pagination when we see actual performance issues.

3. **Create Update UI**: Already implemented! The review missed that lines 298-317 already provide the form for posting updates.

**Decision**: The current implementation is simple and functional. We'll avoid premature optimization.

## Implement (I)

### Files to modify:
1. `/src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx` - Main project detail page
2. No new components needed - use existing UI components

### Implementation steps:
1. Update background and container styling
2. Remove back button
3. Reorganize header with CTA
4. Add updates section using existing POST model
5. Clean up sidebar

## Test (T)

### Test cases:
1. Visual consistency with other pages
2. CTA visibility and functionality
3. Updates posting and display
4. Responsive design on mobile
4. Authorization for updates (only owners/volunteers)
5. Application status display

## Review (R) - Final code review

Use mcp__zen__codereview to ensure:
- Code follows project conventions
- No security issues introduced
- Performance is maintained
- Accessibility is preserved
